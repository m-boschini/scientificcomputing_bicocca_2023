## Description

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It is designed to be played by two players, taking turns to mark the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

The game is implemented in Python and provides a command-line interface for interaction. It includes features such as input validation and a check for game-over conditions.
